# testOpenCV

A real-time sign language recognition tool. (Tensorflow/Keras - Machine Learning, OpenCV - Data Collection, Numpy for Comprehensive Mathematical Functions - 2D Matricies)

Utilizes Tensorflow and Keras to create an Nueral Network that utilizes real-time image pixel data to predict the hand-sign of an individual.  OpenCV is utilized for data collection and for real-time predictions.  By flattening the 2D Matrix of the image data into a single numpy array, the 3 layered Nueral Network learns from the data and makes accurate predictions of what sign language sign the individual is making.
